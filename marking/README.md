# SWEN90006 Assignment 2: Results

Students are expected to save their experimental artefacts into the following folders for marking.

- seed_corpus: all initial sample inputs to be used by the AFLNet fuzzer as seeds.

- others: other artefacts that support the experiments (e.g., fuzzing dictionary).

- generated_corpus: all non-crashing inputs generated by AFLNet (e.g., inputs stored in replayable-queue folder). The marker will use those inputs to recalculate the achieved code coverage.

- pocs: all program inputs and instructions to run them to trigger software vulnerabilities in FotBot.

# Sample command

## Fuzzing fotbot server with a given seed corpus and a given dictionary

```bash
afl-fuzz -d -i sample-corpus -o sample-output -N tcp://127.0.0.1/8888 -x sample.dict -P FOTBOT -D 3000 -q 3 -s 3 -E -K -R $WORKDIR/fotbot/fotbot-fuzz 127.0.0.1 8888
```

## Run a fotbot binary (e.g., fotbot-gcov) with a generated corpus

```bash
replay.sh $WORKDIR/fotbot/fotbot-gcov <path_to_generated_corpus>
```

## Run a fotbot binary with a single input e.g. to confirm a fault

```bash
aflnet-replay <path_to_an_input> FOTBOT 8888 > /dev/null 2>&1 & <path_to_a_fotbot_binary> 127.0.0.1 8888
```
