# SWEN90006 Assignment 2: Results

You are expected to save your experimental artefact into the following folders for marking. Please ensure that you use correct case-sensitive folder names.

- seed_corpus: all initial sample inputs to be used by the AFLNet fuzzer as seeds.

- others: other artefact that support the experiments (e.g., fuzzing dictionary).

- generated_corpus: all non-crashing inputs generated by AFLNet (e.g., inputs stored in replayable-queue folder). The marker will use those inputs to recalculate the achieved code coverage.

- pocs: all program inputs and instructions to run them to trigger software vulnerabilities in FotBot.
